## Technical Decisions & Reasoning

- **Framework:** Chose **Next.js** with **TypeScript** for built-in API support and type safety.
- **State Management:** Used **React Context API** to keep the setup lightweight and simple for global cart state.
- **Styling:** Utilized **Tailwind CSS** to maintain style consistency.
- **API Integration:** Mocked using Next.js API routes (`/api/products`) instead of fetching from an external service.
- **LocalStorage:** Used to persist cart state across page reloads for better user experience.

---

## Assumptions Made

- Product data is static and fetched from a local API route.
- Only in-stock products can be added to cart.
- No backend authentication or user profiles are required.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add product detail pages (`/products/[id]`)
- Add product search functionality
